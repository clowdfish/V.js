# V

> A simple validation library

V is a simple validation plugin for jQuery. This is all you can do with it:

* Declare validation rules in your markup
* Check if a field or a whole form is valid
* Apply side effects (set/remove classes) to input elements or their parent elements

## Install

The easiest way to install V is via [bower](http://bower.io):

```
$ bower install V --save-dev
```

Then you can include V using your favourite build tool, or simply load it into your markup via a `<script>` tag:

```html
<script src="bower_components/V/V.min.js"></script>
```
